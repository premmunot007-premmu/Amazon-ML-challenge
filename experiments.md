# Experiments log

## Plan revision decision (25 Sep, Day 1, post-EDA)
Reviewed the original plan against the EDA numbers below and revised it — full rationale in the plan file's "Revision after Day 1 EDA" section, mirrored in `CLAUDE.md` and `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` §0/§7/timeline. Summary: architecture unchanged; blocking reordered so Day 1 uses chunked sparse TF-IDF only (country as a hard filter) and embeddings+FAISS move to Day 2 as a background job (GPU embedding pass over ~24M strings is too slow to gate today's submission on); exclusivity is now enforced as a hard rule in the decision step (confirmed 0 violations); candidate K starts lower (~15); LightGBM training needs negative downsampling given the pair volume at this scale.

## Dataset scale (measured 25 Sep, Day 1)
- Train: S1 2,206,821 rows | S2 5,034,617 | S3 5,285,604 | ground truth 2,206,822 rows. Train dir ~1.3 GB.
- Test: S1 1,732,545 | S2 4,887,274 | S3 5,082,317. Test dir ~1.2 GB.
- Train S1 country split: US 1,323,633 (60.0%) / India 883,188 (40.0%).
- This is ~5x bigger than the "1M records" placeholder used in the original plan — blocking, chunking and per-country processing are not optional, they're required for this to run on the dev machine (15.4 GB RAM).
- EDA run took several minutes on full data (background job). Ran into two bugs at this scale, both fixed in `src/eda.py`: (1) naive Python loops over millions of ground-truth pairs caused a silent kill/segfault — rewrote with vectorized pandas (`explode`, `.map`, `.value_counts`) instead of per-row `.get()` calls; (2) re-reading train files twice (once for stats, once for GT analysis) pushed memory too far — now reads each file exactly once and reuses it; (3) Windows console is cp1252 by default and crashed printing non-ASCII sample text — forced UTF-8 stdout.

### Ground-truth findings (train, confirmed 25 Sep)
- **Singleton rate: 5.58%** (123,247 / 2,206,821 S1 entities have zero matches). Much lower than we should have assumed going in — most S1 businesses (94.4%) have at least one real match. Consistent across country: US 5.58%, India 5.59%.
- **Matches per S1 is NOT mostly 0/1** — it's concentrated at 2-5, roughly bell-shaped: {0: 123,247 | 1: 119,157 | 2: 375,212 | 3: 530,841 (mode) | 4: 484,115 | 5: 321,957 | 6: 164,868 | 7: 63,968 | 8: 18,680 | 9: 4,205 | 10: 534 | 11: 37}. Design implication: the "predict empty for singletons" case matters (5.6% of macro-F0.5 rows), but the bulk of the score comes from getting 2-5-way match sets right — recall on the FULL set matters more than we initially weighted it.
- **Exclusivity assumption CONFIRMED, perfectly**: 0 / 7,638,365 matched S2/S3 IDs are matched to more than one S1. This validates the plan's exclusivity step (assign each S2/S3 ID to its single best-scoring S1 only) — safe to enforce as a hard constraint, not just a soft filter.
- 7,638,365 total ground-truth pairs: 3,693,619 from S2, 3,944,746 from S3 (close to even).
- 73.36% of S2 records and 74.63% of S3 records have *some* S1 match; the rest (~25-27%) are true non-matches (noise/unrelated records) that must be correctly excluded — this is where precision is won or lost.
- **Country agreement: 100.00%** of matched pairs share the same country label. Blocking can safely restrict candidate search to the same country — this cuts the candidate search space by ~2-3x for free and is a strong precision signal. (Caveat: this is measured on train, which only has US/India; assuming it also holds between France test records and their true source — reasonable given the data design, but keep an eye on it since we can't verify directly on test.)
- business_address is empty for ~3.3% of S2/S3 records (never empty in S1) — normalization must handle missing addresses gracefully, matching on name alone in that case.

### Noise patterns observed in real sample matches (see `artifacts/eda_full_output_day1.txt` for the full 15-example dump)
- **Transliteration is real and severe**, not just theoretical: `Hotel Enterprises Limited` ↔ `होटल एंटरप्राइजेज लिमिटेड` (Devanagari) — same business, same address, no shared characters at all. Character n-gram / edit-distance features are useless here; we need the multilingual embedding retriever in blocking or these are simply unrecoverable.
- **Word-level corruption**: `Maure Williams` → `Maure Wilblims`, `Crystal Staffing` → `Crystal Sttfrifng`, `Warwick` → `Warwik` — classic typo/OCR-style noise, well suited to fuzzy ratio + Levenshtein.
- **Word reordering**: `Orellana Investments LLC` → `LLC Orellana Invsmbens`; `Crystal Staffing Solutions LLC` → `LLC Crystal Sttfrifng Solutions` — token_sort_ratio / token_set_ratio needed, plain `ratio()` will underscore these.
- **Junk/placeholder tokens in address**: literal `<NULL>` string appears in-line in an address (`939389287`). Normalization should strip known placeholder tokens (`<NULL>`, `N/A`, `NONE`, `-`) rather than treating them as content.
- **Bracket/marker noise around legal suffix**: `Obsidian, [[LLC]]`, `[Corp] Dick Regional Armada` — suffix detection regex needs to tolerate surrounding brackets/punctuation.
- **DBA (trade name) records**: `Korbrixx D.B.A. Obsidian, LLC` matches `Obsidian, LLC` — the DBA prefix needs to be either stripped or treated as a separate high-value feature ("does one name contain the other after suffix stripping").
- **Phone numbers embedded directly in the name field**: `Chordia + Pagnters - 7306204978` — names aren't clean; strip trailing numeric/phone-like tokens before name comparison, but don't discard them as a feature (a shared phone number substring would be a very strong signal if it recurs).
- **Missing address is common on the noisy sources**: several S2/S3 examples above have a blank address and only the name to go on (consistent with the 3.3% empty-address stat) — name-only matching path is not a rare edge case, it's routine.
- Confirms the plan's Stage 1/2 design (accent/script-aware embeddings, abbreviation expansion, suffix isolation, token-set fuzzy matching) is the right shape; adds concrete cleanup rules to implement: strip placeholder tokens, tolerate bracket noise around suffixes, strip/feature-ize embedded phone numbers.

## Blocking (src/blocking.py) — final Day 1 design and results (25 Sep, Day 1)

**Final approach**: country-scoped (hard filter) inverted-index token blocking, built as plain
Python dicts (`{key: [candidate_ids]}`), not a pandas DataFrame join. Three key types per
record: adjacent-word bigrams (`B:tok1_tok2`, most selective — naturally much rarer than either
constituent word), single word tokens (`W:tok`, fallback), postal code (`P:code`, exact). Each S1
uses only its own top-3 rarest keys (by candidate-side document frequency) plus postal code if
present — never every token — so every record contributes a small, bounded, maximally-selective
key set regardless of corpus size. Candidates are scored by an IDF-weighted sum (`1/df` per shared
key, postal code weighted at a flat 5.0) and the top-20 per S1 are kept.

**Debugging arc (each of these was a real bug confirmed on real data, not just tuning)**:
1. A flat `max_df=2000` cutoff dropped **every** key for names built from moderately-common
   words (`shree traders`, `federal united group`, `bay holdings group`) — even exact string
   matches got zero candidates. Root cause: at 5-10M-record scale, even fairly distinctive words
   ("twisted"=8,783 occurrences, "packaging"=6,402) blow past any low absolute cutoff; 62.5% of
   all word-key postings mass sat in just 867 of ~1M unique keys. Fixed by switching from "drop
   globally common keys" to "each S1 keeps its own rarest available keys" — recall 27%→39%.
2. Loosening `max_df` to fix that broke runtime: total join work scales with `sum(df)` over
   every key actually used, and moderately-common keys are still expensive in aggregate even
   under per-record selection. A `pandas.merge()`-based join of the full candidate index against
   even one small (~2,031-row) S1 batch produced a 77.8M-row intermediate and crashed on memory.
3. Added S1-side batching (bounds peak memory) and word-bigram keys (naturally far rarer than
   unigrams, so preferred automatically by the existing rarest-key selection) — recall →56.5%,
   zero-candidate exact-match failures →0.
4. Even with bigrams, the `pandas.merge()` architecture itself measured **~40+ hours extrapolated
   to the full 2.2M-row train set** — completely infeasible, because a DataFrame join
   materializes the full matched-row set for every batch regardless of how selective the
   individual keys are. **Fix: replaced the join with direct Python dict lookups** — build
   `{key: [candidate_ids]}` once per country, look up each S1's 2-4 selected keys directly,
   accumulate IDF-weighted scores in a plain dict. This is the same logical computation with
   none of the DataFrame materialization overhead.
5. Profiling the dict-index build itself found `groupby(...).apply(list)` spending ~56 of ~94s
   on just India due to pandas' per-group Python-call overhead across 2.3M groups — replaced
   with numpy `sort_values` + `np.unique(..., return_index=True)` + one bulk `.tolist()` call
   (not one per group) to slice group boundaries out of a single Python list.

**Measured results (train, India+US, 50,000-S1 sample — consistent with a 5,000-S1 sample too,
so numbers are stable, not sampling noise)**:
- Recall: 56.24% (97,217 / 172,874 ground-truth pairs found)
- Zero-candidate S1s (had a true match, got no candidates at all): 0 / 47,139
- Avg candidates per S1: 19.7 (near the K=20 cap)
- Runtime: India 254.6s / 20,004 rows, US 297.4s / 29,996 rows → **full train extrapolates to
  ~4.4 hours** (down from ~40+ hours with the pandas-merge version — ~9x improvement)

**This is a Day 1, single-retriever number, not the final target.** The plan's design is a union
of retrievers; Day 2's embedding+FAISS retriever is specifically meant to catch what token
blocking structurally cannot (transliteration — confirmed necessary: `होटल एंटरप्राइजेज लिमिटेड`
shares zero characters with its Latin-script match — and heavy typos). 56% recall from the cheap
first pass alone is a reasonable Day 1 checkpoint.

**Full-train run**: first launch (~15:56) crashed with `MemoryError` ~2 min in — caused by running
`features.py`/`train.py` concurrently with it (15:58-16:03) for Stage 3 development, exactly the
resource-contention risk flagged earlier but then triggered anyway to make parallel progress.
That trade paid off (got the validated 0.6632 OOF result on the 50k sample) but cost the run.
**Relaunched cleanly at 16:07 with no concurrent heavy jobs** — but crashed again at 18:19, this
time with `pyarrow.lib.ArrowMemoryError: malloc of size 1073741824 failed` while reading a
~272MB source1 parquet. Nothing on our side was running concurrently at that point (confirmed no
other Python processes) — this was external memory pressure elsewhere on the machine, not a bug
in our code. Memory was back to 5.3GB free 11 minutes later. **Relaunched a third time at
18:30**, ~4.4h ETA (~22:50 IST), writing to `artifacts/candidate_pairs_train_full.tsv`. The
50k-sample snapshot used for Stage 3 development is saved at
`artifacts/candidate_pairs_train_sample50k.tsv`.
Lesson: on a 15.4GB shared machine, an unattended multi-hour job can be taken out by memory
pressure we don't control, not just by our own bugs — worth checking `ps` / free RAM on any
unexpected crash before assuming the code is at fault.

**Attempt 3 (18:30) crashed again, immediately** — same error, same place. At that point 5.37GB
was free (not obviously insufficient), with Brave browser using ~4GB across many processes —
this smells like a Windows virtual-memory commit-limit issue (total reserved virtual memory
across all processes vs. physical RAM + pagefile) rather than a simple "not enough free RAM"
situation, which free-RAM alone doesn't show.

**Real fix applied regardless of root cause**: `load_normalized_trimmed()` in blocking.py was
calling `pd.read_parquet(cache_path)` with no column selection, loading **all 12 columns**
(including the full raw `business_name`/`business_address` text — the bulk of each file's size)
only to immediately select down to the 4 columns blocking actually needs and discard the rest.
Fixed via parquet column pushdown (`normalize_and_cache(..., columns=BLOCKING_COLS)`), so unused
columns are never read into memory at all. This is a real, general inefficiency worth having
fixed regardless of whether it was the proximate cause of these crashes — every future full-scale
read now uses meaningfully less peak memory.
**Attempt 4 launched 18:32** with the fix in place — crashed again 11s later, same allocation-failure
pattern but now inside `build_keys`'s bigram explode step, on a tiny 46.2MB allocation.

**Real root cause found**: checked Windows virtual memory directly (`Get-CimInstance
Win32_OperatingSystem`), not just physical RAM. `FreeVirtualMemory` was ~4.16GB — *lower* than
free physical RAM (5.19GB) — because the pagefile is small (~5.3GB, auto-managed) and total
system commit was near its ceiling, driven by the Brave browser's many processes reserving large
amounts of virtual address space. This is a Windows virtual-memory-commit-limit problem, not a
bug in the pipeline: every prior crash (40MB, 496MB, 1GB, 46MB, all different code paths) was
the same underlying cause at different, essentially random trigger points. **Free RAM alone was
not a reliable signal for whether an allocation would succeed on this machine** — worth checking
`FreeVirtualMemory` specifically, not just `FreePhysicalMemory`, on any further unexplained crash.

User closed/reduced Brave; `FreeVirtualMemory` rose to 9.43GB. **Attempt 5 launched 20:12.**

**Attempt 5 progress**: India completed successfully — **17,522,668 candidate pairs**. Wall-clock
showed 43,397.6s (~12h) but `Get-Process`'s cumulative CPU-time check showed only ~3h54m of real
CPU work across the whole run to that point — confirms the wall-clock inflation is genuinely from
the laptop sleeping (Windows suspends processes cleanly; time.time() elapsed still counts the
suspended duration), not a real slowdown. Requested `keep_awake` (session_idle) partway through
to make later readings trustworter — but that tool explicitly does NOT prevent lid-close or
manual sleep, only idle timeout, so wall-clock readings for the rest of this run are still not
fully trustworthy without the user manually keeping the lid open / disabling lid-close sleep.

**Attempt 5 then crashed during the US phase** with a plain `MemoryError` (not an allocation-size
message this time) inside `_score_s1_batch`'s per-entity score accumulation loop — after ~15h
wall-clock (~3h54m+ CPU time by that point). Root cause: with `top_r_tokens=3` word/bigram keys
plus a possible postal key, and each key capped at `max_df=50,000` postings, one entity's
`scores` accumulator dict could in the worst case (near-zero overlap between the four keys'
postings) reach ~4×50,000 = 200,000 entries — rare enough not to appear in 5k/50k-row samples,
real at 2.2M rows.

**Compounding problem this crash exposed**: the run had **no checkpointing** — a crash during the
US phase meant India's already-completed 17.5M pairs would have to be recomputed from scratch on
retry, at the cost of redoing ~2h of real compute (plus whatever wall-clock/sleep inflation).

**Two fixes applied**:
1. A cap (`MAX_SCORES_PER_ENTITY = 100_000`) on the per-entity accumulator: once an entity's own
   `scores` dict reaches this size it already has far more candidates than the top-k it needs, so
   further keys are skipped for that entity rather than let the dict grow unbounded.
2. **Per-country checkpointing** in `compute_candidates()`: each country's result is saved to
   `artifacts/blocking_checkpoints_{split}/_country_{country}.parquet` immediately after
   computing, and loaded from there instead of recomputed on a later run. Only applies to full
   (non-`--sample-s1`) runs, to avoid a stale sampled checkpoint being mistaken for a full one.

**Considered but explicitly declined**: parallelizing the blocking join across CPU cores via
`multiprocessing` to cut real compute time. Windows' `multiprocessing` uses `spawn`, not `fork` —
each worker would need its own full copy of the (potentially multi-GB) postings dict rather than
sharing one via copy-on-write, which risks reintroducing the exact memory crashes just fixed for
an unproven speed win. Not worth the risk under time pressure; worth reconsidering later with a
proper shared-memory design if blocking needs to be rerun many more times.

**Attempt 6 launched 11:50** (no checkpoint existed yet from attempt 5, so India recomputes once
more; from now on a crash won't lose a completed country's work).

## Full-train blocking: SUCCESS (26 Sep, attempt 6)

Both countries completed and checkpointed:
- India: 17,522,668 pairs (20,213.2s wall-clock this attempt)
- US: 25,878,257 pairs (8,873.1s wall-clock)
- **Total: 43,400,925 candidate pairs**, written to `artifacts/candidate_pairs_train_full.tsv`
  (2,206,821 rows — full S1 coverage) and `artifacts/candidate_scores_train.parquet` (with score
  + rank, for feature engineering).

`measure_recall` then crashed with `MemoryError` — but only in the diagnostic step, *after* both
output files were already safely written. Root cause: its pandas two-column merge (43.4M
candidate pairs x 7.6M ground-truth pairs) needed more memory than was available for the
internal join factorization. Fixed the same way as normalize.py's earlier bugs — avoid heavy
string-object structures at this row count. First fix attempt (string-concat + Python set) also
crashed; the working fix encodes both id columns to compact int64 codes (shared factorization
across both frames) and compares with `numpy.isin` — dense integer arrays instead of strings/
tuples/sets, dramatically lighter at this scale.

**Real full-scale recall: 56.10%** (4,285,280 / 7,638,365) — matches the 50k-sample estimate
(56.24%) almost exactly, confirming the sample-based calibration was representative all along.
Only 55 / 2,083,574 S1s with a true match got zero candidates (0.0026%) — negligible, consistent
with the sample's "0 zero-candidate failures" finding at a scale where a handful of edge cases
are expected.

**CPU-time monitoring during this run** (via `Get-Process`, not wall-clock) showed real,
observable variance in utilization: some windows near 100% CPU (steady progress), one ~1h
stretch at only ~6% (likely sleep or memory-pressure thrashing) — confirms `time.time()`-based
elapsed logging in these scripts still isn't a reliable duration signal on this machine; only
`Get-Process`'s cumulative CPU time is.

**Next**: run `features.py` on the full 43.4M-pair set, retrain `train.py` (now saves models via
`--model-dir`, see the `decide.py` addition below) to get a real full-scale OOF score, then move
to test-set blocking.

## Full train_oof memory debugging arc, then strategy pivot (26 Sep)

Training LightGBM on all 43.4M rows hit a long chain of full-scale-only memory issues, each
fixed in turn (see the commit history for exact details): mixed-dtype feature columns forcing
float64 upcasts inside both pandas and LightGBM's internal conversion, `df.iloc[]` on the full
28-column frame dragging id columns along unnecessarily, a fold's ~35M-row training slice and
the full 43.4M-row X_all needing to coexist in memory. The dtype fix (float32/int32/int8
throughout) and building X_all as one column-by-column-constructed array were real, confirmed
improvements — each got the crash further before the next bottleneck appeared, and each was
verified byte-for-byte / value-identical against the known-good 50k-sample result before being
trusted at scale.

The X_all-vs-fold-slice memory conflict was fixed by backing X_all with a memory-mapped file
(consistent with this project's earlier diagnosis that Windows' virtual-memory *commit limit*,
not physical RAM, is the tighter constraint on this machine) — but this then hit a **native
access violation inside LightGBM's C library** (`LGBM_DatasetCreateFromMat`), not a catchable
Python `MemoryError`. This is a different class of problem: LightGBM's low-level array handling
doesn't appear to interact safely with memmap-backed numpy arrays on Windows, and debugging a
native crash inside a compiled C extension is a much larger, less certain time investment than
the pure-Python memory fixes so far.

**Decision: stop pushing full 43.4M-row training through this machine, train on a large
subsample instead.** Full-scale blocking (43.4M pairs, 56.1% recall) and full-scale feature
computation (894MB parquet, correct/verified) both already succeeded — that work isn't wasted.
`sample_features.py` (new) samples ~400-500k S1 entities' worth of rows directly from the
already-computed `features_train_full.parquet` via pyarrow predicate pushdown (never loads the
full file), giving ~8-10M pairs — comfortably within memory territory already proven reliable
(the 50k sample's ~983k pairs trained without issue), while being a substantially larger and
more representative training set than the original 50k-S1 development sample.

## First complete, valid submission produced (26-27 Sep, overnight)

Picked back up the pivot plan from the previous entry and ran it through to completion:

1. **`sample_features.py`**: sampled 500,000 S1 entities (~9.8M pairs) from the full train
   features — took ~12s (predicate pushdown, never touches the full 43.4M-row file).
2. **Trained on the 500k sample**: OOF macro F0.5 = **0.6636** at τ=0.50 (consistent with the
   50k sample's 0.6631, now on 10x the data). 5 fold models saved to `artifacts/models_full/`.
3. **Full test-set blocking**: ran cleanly end to end this time (one transient crash on the
   France→India transition, same known `explode()` memory-pressure pattern, fixed by a plain
   retry — France's checkpoint was reused, no recomputation). Final numbers:
   - France: 5,067,199 pairs (34m)
   - India: 16,090,796 pairs (2h40m)
   - US: 12,839,502 pairs (41m — faster than estimated)
   - **Total: 33,997,497 candidate pairs, full coverage of all 1,732,544 test S1 entities**
   - Total wall-clock: ~3h23m — close to the ~3.5-4h estimate, no sleep-inflation this run.
4. **Test features**: 33,997,497 rows computed in ~10.5 min, no crash (all the batching/dtype
   fixes from the train run held up at test scale too).
5. **`decide.py`**: applied the 500k-sample model ensemble, enforced exclusivity, threshold
   τ=0.50 (from training) → `output/matching_results.tsv` (1,732,544 rows: 1,271,476 with a
   match, 461,068 predicted singletons) + `output/candidate_pairs.tsv` (copied through).
6. **`utils/validate_submission.py --check-ids`: PASS.** Every ID in both files genuinely
   exists in the test set; no format violations.

**Honest read on the singleton rate**: 461,068/1,732,544 ≈ 26.6% predicted singletons, far
above train's true ~5.6% singleton rate. This is expected given blocking recall (~56%) — many
entities with real matches simply have no candidate clearing threshold, so the model defaults
them to "no match." Not a bug, just the recall ceiling showing up directly in the submission;
the private-leaderboard score will very likely reflect that ceiling until Day 2 embeddings
improve recall.

**Status: a complete, valid, submission-ready file exists at `output/matching_results.tsv` /
`output/candidate_pairs.tsv`.** Uploading to the actual portal is the user's own action.

## First real leaderboard score: public LB F0.5 = 0.658 (27 Sep morning)

Uploaded the file above. **Public LB F0.5 = 0.658**, vs. OOF 0.6636 — only ~0.6% apart,
confirming the GroupKFold + exact-metric threshold sweep is well-calibrated, not overfit to
the training sample. Logged in `submissions.md`.

## Exact-name-match supplementary blocking pass (27 Sep)

Investigated real recall-miss cases (S1 entities whose true match is missing from candidates)
by inspecting 20 actual examples rather than theorizing. Found a genuinely mixed bag:
roughly a third were **fixable blocking-logic gaps**, not cases needing semantic embeddings —
word reordering breaking bigram overlap (`orthopedic safe health` vs `orthopedic health safe`,
zero shared bigrams despite identical words) and, more strikingly, **exact string matches still
missing** (`krishna power` -> `krishna power`, `united agro` -> `united agro` — identical
strings, dropped because the phrase is common enough to exceed even the rarest-token
selection's effective reach). Full multilingual embeddings were separately sized at ~12.6h of
CPU compute for the whole dataset — infeasible on the last day — so this cheaper, evidence-based
fix was pursued first.

**`exact_match_candidates.py`** (new): for each country, merge S1 and S2/S3 records on exact
`name_core` — vectorized per-country merge, not a Python loop over groups (would have repeated
blocking.py's original mistake). First uncapped run on train produced **75.2M pairs** — nearly
double the entire existing candidate set — because a handful of very generic/short names
(median group size 4, but max 1,359) dominate the count. Added `max_group_size=50` (mirrors
blocking.py's `max_df`, just for whole-name groups instead of tokens): cut train to **6.1M pairs**
(India 1.75M, US 4.35M), test to **5.0M pairs** (France 1.26M, India 1.64M, US 2.07M).

**`merge_candidates.py`** (new): unions blocking.py's token/bigram candidates with the
exact-match candidates, working entirely from flat parquet sources
(`candidate_scores_{split}.parquet`, never the comma-joined TSV — re-exploding that at full
scale crashed with MemoryError more than once already this project).

**Measured recall gain on train: 56.10% -> 57.75% (+1.65pp)**, from combined pairs
43.4M -> 44.46M (most exact-match pairs already existed in the token/bigram set).

**Retrained on a fresh 500k-S1 sample of the merged candidates: OOF macro F0.5 = 0.6762 at
τ=0.55** (up from 0.6636 at τ=0.50) — a genuine, real improvement matching the recall gain, not
noise. Models saved to `artifacts/models_merged/`.

Regenerated test predictions (`decide.py` with the new model + merged test candidates):
1,732,544 rows, 451,981 predicted singletons (down from 461,068), 1,280,563 with a match (up
from 1,271,476). **`utils/validate_submission.py --check-ids`: PASS.** New
`output/matching_results.tsv` is ready — a second, improved submission, not yet uploaded.

## Sorted-token (reorder-tolerant) supplementary pass — a second cheap win (27 Sep)

User asked to keep improving before uploading again. Generalized `exact_match_candidates.py`
to accept a `--key-mode`: `exact` (raw core name, already built) or `sorted` (name_core with
its words alphabetically sorted — "orthopedic safe health" and "orthopedic health safe" both
become "health orthopedic safe"). This directly targets the word-reordering recall-miss
category identified earlier: adjacent-word bigrams have zero overlap when word order differs,
even if every word matches. Same vectorized per-country merge + `max_group_size=50` cap as the
exact-match pass, no new engineering risk.

- Train: France n/a, India 1.80M, US 4.60M -> **6.40M sorted-match pairs**
- Test: France 1.32M, India 1.69M, US 2.19M -> **5.20M sorted-match pairs**

**Measured incremental recall gain on train**: bigram-only 56.10% -> +exact 57.75% ->
**+sorted 59.02%** (+1.27pp on top of exact-match, +2.92pp total over baseline). Confirms the
reordering hypothesis was real, not a one-off from the 20-case sample.

Generalized `merge_candidates.py` to take a `--extra-modes` list (default `exact sorted`)
instead of hardcoding two sources, so adding a third pass didn't require new merge logic.

**Retrained on a fresh 500k-S1 sample of the triple-merged candidates: OOF macro F0.5 = 0.6840
at τ=0.55** — up from 0.6762 (exact-match only) and 0.6636 (baseline). Total progression:
**0.6636 -> 0.6762 -> 0.6840**, a genuine +3.1% relative improvement, entirely from cheap
(minutes-scale) supplementary blocking passes — no multi-hour embedding compute needed.

Regenerated test predictions: 1,732,544 rows, 446,070 predicted singletons (down again from
451,981), 1,286,474 with a match. **`utils/validate_submission.py --check-ids`: PASS.**
`output/matching_results.tsv` now holds this third, further-improved version — not yet
uploaded (public LB currently only reflects the first submission, 0.658, from the baseline
model before either supplementary pass).

## Theoretical ceiling check + "more data" test (27 Sep)

User asked whether something substantial could push the score above 0.8. Worked out the
ceiling a theoretically *perfect* classifier could reach on our current candidates (59%
blocking recall, 5.6% singleton rate): entities with matches get precision=1.0 (only true
positives ever selected) and ~59% recall -> F0.5≈0.878 each; singletons get 1.0. Weighted
average: **~0.885 ceiling**. We're at 0.684 — a large gap below that ceiling, meaning the
bottleneck right now is **classifier/feature quality, not blocking recall**. The
originally-planned "context/rank features" (candidate rank within its S1's shortlist,
reverse-rank, score gap to the best candidate — flagged in the plan as "usually the strongest
feature group") were never actually implemented in `features.py`. That's the concrete gap.

**Tested "train on more data" as a lower-risk lever first** (500k -> 1M S1, ~20.3M rows,
~38 min, no crash — confirms memmap-based training is reliable well past 500k, just not
tested at the full 2.2M/43M-row scale that crashed originally). **Result: OOF F0.5 0.6840 ->
0.6848 — only +0.0008, essentially noise.** Real, useful finding: data volume is NOT the
bottleneck at the current feature set; the model was already data-sufficient at 500k. This
sharpens the priority — rank/context features are the higher-payoff lever to pursue next, not
further scaling the training sample.

## Rank/context features added (27 Sep) — the previously-planned, never-built feature group

Implemented `add_rank_features.py`: a post-process pass over an existing features parquet
(rather than rebuilding features.py from scratch) that adds 7 new columns per (S1, candidate)
pair, using a cheap heuristic proxy score (0.7×name_token_set + 0.3×addr_token_set, falling
back to name-only when either address is empty) purely to rank candidates — the raw
similarity features remain available separately for the model:
- `f_rank_in_s1` / `f_reverse_rank_in_s1` / `f_group_size_s1` / `f_score_gap_to_best_in_s1`:
  this candidate's rank (and gap to the best) among all candidates competing for the same S1.
- `f_rank_for_cand` / `f_group_size_cand` / `f_score_gap_to_best_for_cand`: the reverse
  direction — this S1's rank (and gap to the best) among all S1s competing for the same
  candidate. Directly relevant to the exclusivity rule (each candidate goes to only one S1).

Implementation note: computing this needs a global groupby/rank over the whole candidate set,
which doesn't fit features.py's per-batch streaming design. Kept memory bounded by
factorizing the two ID columns to int32 codes and dropping the raw strings immediately (each
one costs several GB at 35-45M rows otherwise — the same pattern that caused MemoryErrors
earlier in this project), doing the actual rank computation with numpy (bincount +
searchsorted for group boundaries, one lexsort) instead of pandas groupby, and streaming the
final rewrite back onto the original file via `pyarrow.iter_batches` + `ParquetWriter`. Ran in
under 2 minutes at full scale on both splits (train: 44,734,891 rows / 2,206,776 S1s; test:
35,162,542 rows / 1,732,492 S1s) — negligible cost next to the hours blocking.py and
features.py took.

**Result on the same 500k-S1 sample used for the 0.6840 baseline: OOF F0.5 0.6840 -> 0.6903
(+0.0063, tau=0.60).** A real, meaningful gain — about 8x the +0.0008 the 1M-data test gave,
though still smaller than the two blocking-fix passes (+0.0126, +0.0078). LightGBM's split-gain
importances confirm the new features carry real signal: `f_score_gap_to_best_for_cand` ranks
**3rd overall** by total gain (6.33e8, behind only f_name_len_a and f_name_ratio), and
`f_rank_for_cand` ranks 7th (1.57e8). Notably the **reverse-direction** (per-candidate) rank
features dominate — the forward-direction (per-S1) ones (`f_rank_in_s1`,
`f_reverse_rank_in_s1`, `f_group_size_s1`, `f_score_gap_to_best_in_s1`) rank much lower
(roughly 590k-7.9M gain, near the bottom of the 28-feature list). Plausible reason: exclusivity
is enforced downstream in decide.py regardless, so what the model most needs from the rank
features is "is some OTHER S1 a stronger claimant for this same candidate?" — exactly what the
per-candidate features encode — rather than its own S1's shortlist shape.

Progression so far, same metric, comparable sample size: 0.6636 -> 0.6762 -> 0.6840 -> 0.6903
(baseline -> exact-match -> sorted-token -> rank/context), a cumulative +0.0267 (+4.0%
relative). Regenerated and validated test predictions with the merged3 model (models_merged3_500k)
+ merged2 test candidates — `utils/validate_submission.py --check-ids` PASSes. Ready as a
fourth submission candidate; not yet uploaded.

## LightGBM hyperparameter tuning (27 Sep)

Added CLI overrides to `train.py` (`--num-leaves`, `--learning-rate`, `--min-data-in-leaf`,
`--num-boost-round`, `--early-stopping-rounds`) instead of hardcoding a new script — the
existing LGB_PARAMS (num_leaves=31, min_data_in_leaf=50, learning_rate=0.05) had never been
tuned. Reasoning for the first variant tried: 500k S1 -> ~10.1M rows is a lot of data for
31-leaf trees to only lightly use; tried num_leaves=63, min_data_in_leaf=30 (loosened to let
the bigger trees actually split that far), learning_rate=0.04 (slightly lower to compensate
for the higher-variance deeper trees, with early stopping already in place to control rounds).

**Result: OOF F0.5 0.6903 -> 0.6916 (+0.0013)** on the same rank-features 500k sample. Small
but real and in the expected direction. Diminishing-returns pattern similar to the 1M-data
test, suggesting hyperparameters were already reasonably close to good for this feature set —
unlike the rank/context features, which added genuinely new information, tuning here is
squeezing marginal gains out of information the model already had access to.

Regenerated and validated test predictions using this tuned model (models_merged3_tuned1) —
fifth submission candidate, OOF 0.6916, not yet uploaded. Running progression: 0.6636 ->
0.6762 -> 0.6840 -> 0.6903 -> 0.6916 (cumulative +0.0280, +4.2% relative over the original
baseline).

## Squashed-name (nospace) blocking pass (27 Sep) — biggest single recall gain so far

Rather than guess at the next fix, wrote `diagnose_recall_misses.py`: samples real
ground-truth pairs the current candidate set (blocking + exact + sorted) still misses, with
actual name/address text side by side, using the same integer-encoded comparison pattern as
`measure_recall`. 40 real misses inspected fell into a few clear buckets: (1) one side's name
run together with no spaces, sometimes with a trailing domain-like word — 'creative systems'
vs 'creativesystems com', 'shalom network' vs 'shalomnetwork', 'roman animal hospital' vs
'romananimalhospital com' — distinct from reordering since one side is a single token and
sorting it changes nothing; (2) Devanagari/Bengali/Kannada transliteration (genuinely hard
without embeddings); (3) real typos (needs fuzzy/edit-distance blocking, not exact-key); (4)
a handful of literally-identical names ('northwind', 'viis', 'family specialists') apparently
still dropped by the exact-match pass's `max_group_size=50` genericity cap — a separate,
not-yet-investigated issue.

Targeted bucket (1): added a `nospace` key_mode to `exact_match_candidates.py` — squashes all
whitespace out of `name_core` after dropping one trailing domain-suffix word (com/in/org/net/
co/biz/info) if present, same country-scoped/capped structure as exact/sorted. **Measured
recall gain: 59.02% -> 61.47%, +2.45pp** — the biggest single supplementary-pass gain so far,
bigger than exact (+1.65pp) and sorted (+1.27pp) individually.

Hit a real memory bug measuring this: the first gain-measurement script did `pd.concat` +
`drop_duplicates()` on ~62M raw string-ID rows across 4 parquet files and thrashed for 10+
minutes under low free-virtual-memory (same class of problem as several earlier crashes in
this project) before being killed and rewritten with integer-encoded factorization — finished
in under 4 minutes once fixed. Applied the same lesson when regenerating features: reused
`features.py`'s existing `load_candidate_pairs()` (explodes the comma-joined
candidate_pairs.tsv) crashed outright with `ArrayMemoryError` at the new 45.2M-pair merged
scale — added `load_candidate_pairs_from_sources()` (new `--extra-modes` CLI arg) which builds
the pairs frame directly from the flat per-mode parquets instead, deduping via integer keys
instead of `drop_duplicates()` on strings. Full recompute went cleanly after that fix:
- `features_train_merged4.parquet`: 45,185,457 rows, 4,695,401 positives (10.39%) — matches
  the 61.47% recall measurement exactly. ~15 min full-scale (train candidate pairs 45.2M).
- `features_test_merged4.parquet`: regenerating next (candidate pairs 35,475,094).

Ran `add_rank_features.py` on both full-scale merged4 files -> `features_{split}_merged5.parquet`
(train: 45,185,457 rows; test: 35,475,094 rows), resampled 500k S1 from train, retrained with
the same tuned hyperparameters (num_leaves=63, min_data_in_leaf=30, learning_rate=0.04).

**Result: OOF macro F0.5 0.6916 -> 0.7059 (+0.0143, tau=0.60)** — the biggest single gain of
the night, confirming the +2.45pp recall improvement from the nospace pass translated directly
into classifier quality, not just more (mostly-negative) candidates for the model to reject.
First time crossing 0.70. Regenerated and validated test predictions
(`utils/validate_submission.py --check-ids`: PASS) — 1,297,775 / 1,732,544 test entities
predicted with at least one match, 434,769 singletons. Sent to the user as the current best
submission candidate; not yet uploaded to the leaderboard.

**Full night's progression, same metric family, comparable ~500k-S1 sample size:**
0.6636 -> 0.6762 -> 0.6840 -> 0.6903 -> 0.6916 -> **0.7059**
(baseline -> exact-match -> sorted-token -> rank/context -> hyperparameter tuning -> nospace).
Cumulative +0.0423 (+6.4% relative) over the first real submission. Blocking recall over the
same progression: 56.10% -> 57.75% -> 59.02% -> (unchanged) -> (unchanged) -> 61.47%.

**Negative/neutral results from the same session, for completeness:** training on 2x the data
(500k->1M S1) gave only +0.0008 (not the bottleneck).

## Generic-name cap investigated and rejected; address-exact pass added (+4.25pp, biggest gain)

Checked whether raising `max_group_size` (currently 50) would safely rescue the literally-
identical-name misses noted earlier (northwind, viis, family specialists, uptown pub, new
delhi foundation). Measured their actual group sizes: 948, 59, 690, 256, 109 respectively —
these are common template-style names shared by hundreds of genuinely unrelated real
businesses, not near-duplicates. Confirmed via the full group-size distribution: 8,641 groups
in the 51-200 "rescue zone" alone (864,550 records), with pathological outliers up to 1,897
("meridian"). Raising the cap would flood the candidate set with false positives for a
precision-weighted metric — **rejected**, the current cap is doing its job correctly.

Instead targeted the OTHER bucket from the miss diagnosis: transliteration cases where the
address genuinely matches but the name doesn't (translated/transliterated to a different
script). Generalized `exact_match_candidates.py` to take `--key-column` (name_core or
address_clean) instead of hardcoding name_core. Checked the address_clean group-size
distribution first: max group size only 41 (mean 1.23) vs. name's max of 1,897 — addresses are
inherently far more specific, so an exact-match pass on them carries none of the genericity
risk name-based keys do. No cap needed in practice at max_group_size=50 (nothing gets dropped).

**Measured recall gain: 61.47% -> 65.72%, +4.25pp** — from only 1,137,922 new pairs (vs. 6-6.5M
for each of the name-based passes). By far the most efficient and highest-value pass of the
session: a fraction of the pairs, more than 1.5x the recall gain of the next-best pass
(nospace, +2.45pp). Confirms the hypothesis from the miss diagnosis: many "unrecoverable"
name-based misses (transliteration, heavy typos, completely different trade names for the same
business) still have a clean, exact address match — address is the more robust signal exactly
when name normalization/matching breaks down.

Hit two more `MemoryError`/`ArrayMemoryError` crashes measuring this — this time in
`np.unique()`'s internal hash-based dedup path on ~60-70M-element int64 arrays, despite 7-9GB
of free RAM reported at the time (likely virtual-memory fragmentation after many hours of
heavy pandas/numpy work in this session, not a hard resource ceiling). Fixed by switching to a
sort-based dedup (in-place `.sort()` + boolean diff) instead of `np.unique`'s hash-table path —
more predictable memory behavior at this scale, no more crashes after the switch. Worth
remembering for future large-array dedup in this project: prefer sort+diff over `np.unique`
when working with tens of millions of int64 keys.

Ran the full recompute: `candidate_pairs_{split}_merged6.tsv` (train 45,707,028 pairs / test
35,868,318 pairs) -> `features_{split}_merged6.parquet` (raw similarity features) ->
`features_{split}_merged7.parquet` (+ rank/context features) -> resampled 500k S1 -> retrained
with the same tuned hyperparameters (num_leaves=63, min_data_in_leaf=30, learning_rate=0.04).

**Result: OOF macro F0.5 0.7059 -> 0.7501 (+0.0442, tau=0.60)** — by far the single biggest
jump of the session, more than 3x the previous largest gain (nospace's +0.0143). Confirms the
miss-diagnosis-driven approach: methodically sampling and categorizing real misses (instead of
guessing) found a pattern -- address matches exactly even when name normalization fails
completely -- that turned out to carry far more signal than any of the name-based tricks tried
before it.

Hit one more crash regenerating features at this new scale: `features.py`'s
`_build_gt_key_set` (a small, ~2.2M-row ground-truth explode, not the big candidate-pairs one)
hit an `ArrayMemoryError` on a 59 MiB allocation despite 9+ GB free RAM reported moments later
-- a transient peak within that one process's lifetime, not a system-wide shortage. Fixed by
replacing that particular `pandas.explode()` call with a plain Python loop (fast enough at this
row count, and this is now the third pandas-explode-related crash fixed this session by
avoiding the explode/reindex/concat code path entirely at large-ish row counts under memory
pressure).

Regenerating and validating test predictions with this model next -- current best submission
candidate.

**Full night's progression, same metric family, comparable ~500k-S1 sample size:**
0.6636 -> 0.6762 -> 0.6840 -> 0.6903 -> 0.6916 -> 0.7059 -> **0.7501**
(baseline -> exact-match -> sorted-token -> rank/context -> LGB tuning -> nospace ->
address-exact). Cumulative +0.0865 (+13.0% relative) over the first real submission. Blocking
recall over the same progression: 56.10% -> 57.75% -> 59.02% -> (unchanged) -> (unchanged) ->
61.47% -> **65.72%**.

## Address normalization fix (state abbreviations + leading zeros): +4.27pp more (27 Sep)

Re-ran `diagnose_recall_misses.py` on the new (post address-exact-pass) candidate set to find
the next target. Two dominant, clearly fixable patterns emerged from 40 fresh misses:
1. **State name vs. abbreviation mismatch** — ~15/40 examples differ from their true match
   ONLY in this: `'uttar pradesh'` vs `'up'`, `'west bengal'` vs `'wb'`, `'haryana'` vs `'hr'`,
   `'california'` vs `'ca'`, etc. Otherwise byte-identical addresses that the exact-match pass
   currently treats as different strings.
2. **Leading zeros on house/street numbers** — `'1297 lynwood drive...'` vs
   `'001297 lynwood drive...'`.

Both are normalization gaps, not blocking-strategy gaps — fixing them in `normalize_address`
lets the *existing* address-exact pass catch far more for free, no new key_mode needed. Added
to `normalize.py`: a one-directional (full-name -> abbreviation only, never the reverse, which
would be ambiguous — "or" is Oregon in a US address but Odisha in an Indian one) state-name
canonicalization dict covering all US states + major Indian states (hand-written domain rule,
not an external lookup, per CLAUDE.md's fair-play rules), applied as a phrase-level regex
substitution; and a leading-zero strip restricted to the START of the address string only
(so a genuine postal code elsewhere in the string, which can legitimately start with 0, e.g.
some Massachusetts ZIPs, is never touched). Smoke-tested against the actual 4 examples from
the miss sample — all 4 became byte-identical after the fix.

Re-normalized all 6 `norm_{train,test}_source{1,2,3}.parquet` files (confirmed this doesn't
touch `blocking.py`'s inputs — it only reads `name_core`/`postal_code`, both untouched by this
fix — so the expensive multi-hour blocking pass does NOT need to be redone, only the
address-exact pass and everything downstream of it). Re-ran the address-exact pass on train:
pair count nearly doubled, 1,137,922 -> 2,208,396.

**Measured recall: 65.72% -> 69.99%, +4.27pp** — essentially matching the original
address-exact pass's own gain, from a pure normalization fix on top of it. Confirms address
was even more informative than the first measurement suggested; the state-abbreviation noise
alone was masking a large share of otherwise-clean address matches, especially for India (47%
of test) where the state-abbreviation pattern is common.

Also hit and fixed a genuine bug in `diagnose_recall_misses.py` while re-running it: its
`np.isin()` call was still crashing with `MemoryError` even after switching `have_key_sorted`'s
computation to sort-based dedup, because `np.isin()` unconditionally calls `np.unique()`
*internally* on its second argument unless told not to — pre-deduping the input doesn't skip
that internal call by itself. Fixed by passing `assume_unique=True` (valid here since both
arguments actually are unique/sortable candidate-pair keys). Worth remembering: sort-based
dedup alone doesn't fully replace `np.unique()`-avoidance in `np.isin()` calls — need
`assume_unique=True` too.

Ran the full recompute: `candidate_pairs_{split}_merged8.tsv` (train 46,229,295 pairs / test
36,135,698 pairs) -> `features_{split}_merged8.parquet` (raw similarity features, now computed
against the re-normalized address_clean) -> `features_{split}_merged9.parquet` (+ rank/context
features) -> resampled 500k S1 -> retrained with the same tuned hyperparameters.

**Result: OOF macro F0.5 0.7501 -> 0.7894 (+0.0393, tau=0.60)** — confirms the address
normalization fix's +4.27pp recall gain (65.72% -> 69.99%) translated directly into classifier
quality, not just noise reduction. Now within reach of the user's >0.8 target for the first
time. Regenerating and validating test predictions with this model next.

**Full night's progression, same metric family, comparable ~500k-S1 sample size:**
0.6636 -> 0.6762 -> 0.6840 -> 0.6903 -> 0.6916 -> 0.7059 -> 0.7501 -> **0.7894**
(baseline -> exact-match -> sorted-token -> rank/context -> LGB tuning -> nospace ->
address-exact -> address-normalization-fix). Cumulative +0.1258 (+19.0% relative) over the
first real submission. Blocking recall: 56.10% -> 57.75% -> 59.02% -> 61.47% -> 65.72% ->
**69.99%**.

## decide.py added + train.py now persists models (26 Sep)

`train.py`'s `train_oof` only returned OOF predictions before — useless for inference on test
data, which has no fold assignment. Added `save_models()`: each fold's booster
(`fold_{i}.txt`), the feature-column list, and the tuned threshold go to `--model-dir/meta.json`.
`decide.py` (new): loads that ensemble, averages all folds' predictions (standard bagging — no
leakage risk since no fold ever saw test data), enforces exclusivity, applies the threshold, and
writes `matching_results.tsv` + copies `candidate_pairs.tsv` through unchanged (already in the
exact required format).

**Defaults landed on**: `--max-df 50000` (calibrated middle ground — lower drops legitimate keys,
higher reintroduces expensive joins), `--top-r-tokens 3`, `--s1-chunk-size 50000` (memory-only
concern now, not a join-size safety net), `k=20` candidates per S1.

## Stage 3 (features.py + train.py) — first end-to-end result (25 Sep, Day 1)

Built while the full-train blocking run (above) proceeds in the background. Developed and
validated against `artifacts/candidate_pairs_train_sample50k.tsv` (the 50k-S1 sample snapshot).

**Two more memory bugs caught before they hit the full run** (both same root cause as earlier:
scoping to the full dataset instead of the sample actually in scope):
1. `features.py`'s `load_filtered()` originally loaded the full ~670MB source2/3 parquet before
   `.isin()`-filtering — risky with as little as ~2.4-3.9GB free RAM while the concurrent
   full-train blocking job runs. Fixed with pyarrow predicate pushdown
   (`pd.read_parquet(..., filters=[("entity_id","in",ids)])`) so non-matching rows are never
   materialized as Python objects at all.
2. `attach_labels()` exploded the *full* 7.6M-row ground truth before merging against a 50k-S1
   sample's ~983k pairs — segfaulted (exit 139) under the same concurrent memory pressure. Fixed
   by filtering ground truth to the sample's S1 scope before exploding (same fix pattern as
   `blocking.py`'s `measure_recall`).

**26 pairwise features** (`f_` prefix): rapidfuzz ratio/partial/token_sort/token_set on core name
and address, name token Jaccard, legal-suffix agreement, postal/house-number agreement, landmark
flags, containment, acronym match, phone-in-name flags, name lengths. Verified on a 100-S1 smoke
test before running full: positives had mean `f_name_ratio` 90.5 vs negatives 67.0 — clearly
discriminative.

**Model**: LightGBM, 5-fold GroupKFold by `source1_entity_id` (no S1's pairs split across
train/val). Trained on the 50k-sample's 982,643 pairs (97,217 positives, 9.89%) in ~70s total.

**Top features by gain**: `f_addr_token_set` dominates by a wide margin (2.77M, ~7.6x the next
feature), then `f_addr_ratio`, `f_house_conflict`, `f_name_token_sort`. **Address similarity is
the single strongest signal** — stronger than any name feature. `f_acronym_match` and
`f_name_has_phone_a` had zero importance on this sample (rare conditions, small sample — revisit
once trained on the full dataset).

**Decision layer**: exclusivity enforced (each candidate → its single best-scoring S1 only, per
the confirmed hard rule), then threshold τ swept in the exact macro F0.5 metric.

**Result: OOF macro F0.5 = 0.6632 at τ=0.50** (singletons 0.8693, with-matches 0.6507). This is
capped by this sample's ~56% blocking recall — a real, honest number, but expect it to rise
substantially once blocking recall improves (Day 2 embeddings) and once trained on the full
2.2M-row train set instead of a 50k sample. Threshold behaved sensibly: singleton accuracy rises
monotonically with τ (as expected — higher bar to predict any match), while with-matches score
peaks around τ=0.40-0.55, consistent with the precision/recall trade-off F0.5 is designed around.

Artifacts: `artifacts/features_train_sample50k.parquet`, `artifacts/oof_train_sample50k.parquet`.

## Bug caught while building `src/normalize.py` (25 Sep, Day 1)
Two-part bug that would have silently corrupted every non-Latin-script name (Devanagari, and presumably other scripts) before either the classic 3-5 confirmed on Day 1) or the Day 2 embedding retriever ever saw the text — caught with a smoke test before it touched real data:
1. `strip_accents` used `unicodedata.combining(c)` to detect "accent marks to strip" after NFKD decomposition. That's too broad — it strips *any* Unicode combining mark, including Devanagari vowel signs (matras), which are not accents but structural parts of the letters. Fix: only strip combining marks in the U+0300-U+036F block (where Latin accents decompose to).
2. Separately, the punctuation-stripping regex was `[^\w\s&]` ("keep only word characters"). Python's `\w` does **not** include Unicode mark categories (Mn/Mc) — so this regex was *also* independently stripping Devanagari vowel signs (e.g. the "ो" in होटल is category `Mc`), regardless of fix #1. Fix: strip an explicit ASCII punctuation set instead of "anything not \w", so any script's letters/marks pass through untouched.
- Verified fix with a smoke test: `होटल एंटरप्राइजेज लिमिटेड` now survives `normalize_name()` unchanged (previously became `ह टल ए टरप र इज ज ल म ट ड` — unrecoverable garbage).
- **Lesson for the rest of the pipeline**: any future text-cleaning code must be smoke-tested against the real non-Latin samples in this file before running on full data — `\w`/accent-stripping bugs are easy to write and easy to miss if you only test on English samples.

## Address-sorted-token pass + native-script state names: OOF F0.5 crosses 0.80 (27 Sep)

A third `diagnose_recall_misses.py` pass (on the post-address-normalization-fix candidate set,
69.99% recall) found two more concrete patterns: (1) **address token reordering** — the exact
same tokens, different order (e.g. `'ward number 16 gandhi nagar...maharajganj up'` vs
`'up maharajganj...ward number 16...gandhi nagar...'`) — directly covered by the *existing*
`exact_match_candidates.py --key-mode sorted --key-column address_clean` combination, needing
**zero new code**; and (2) **native-script state names** as address suffixes (e.g. `'shivam
developers'`, identical name, address differing only in `'tg'` vs `'తెలంగాణ'`) — the earlier
state-abbreviation fix only covered Latin-script full names.

Ran the sorted-address-token pass: **+3.85pp recall** (69.99% -> 73.84%) — the third-largest
single gain of the session. Extended `normalize.py`'s `INDIA_STATE_ABBREV` dict with
native-script full names (Devanagari, Telugu, Bengali, Kannada, Tamil, Gujarati) for the states
directly observed in misses — hit and fixed a self-inflicted bug along the way (two characters
copy-pasted from the wrong Unicode script block, caught via a systematic script-consistency
scan before it could silently corrupt data). Re-normalized all 6 source files, re-ran both
address passes: **+0.77pp more** (73.84% -> 74.61%).

Ran the full recompute on the combined result: `candidate_pairs_{split}_merged10.tsv` (train
46,774,700 pairs / test 36,512,377 pairs) -> `features_{split}_merged10/11.parquet` -> resampled
500k S1 -> retrained with the same tuned hyperparameters.

**Result: OOF macro F0.5 0.7894 -> 0.8278 (+0.0384, tau=0.65) — first time crossing 0.80**, the
target set explicitly for this improvement push.

Hit a genuine disk-full crash partway through: `D:` filled to 100% (0 bytes free) from
accumulating every intermediate parquet across 11 "merged" rounds this session — freed ~21GB
by deleting clearly-superseded raw (pre-rank-features) feature files from rounds 1-8 (each
already had a "+rank" successor that was what actually got used for training) plus the
original pre-merge `_full.parquet` files and an abandoned 1M-S1 sample experiment. Also
discovered mid-run that `C:` was independently at 98% full (3.8GB free) — likely the real
root cause of several of this session's earlier "transient" memory slowdowns/crashes all
night, since Windows' pagefile/virtual-memory commit backing typically lives there; the final
training run completed successfully but visibly slowly under that pressure (~17,400
cumulative CPU-seconds for a run that normally takes ~2,000). **This is a standing hardware/OS
constraint on this machine, not something fixed by a code change** — worth clearing before any
future session on this machine attempts full-scale work again.

Regenerated and validated test predictions with this model (`models_merged11_500k`) — current
best submission candidate.

**Full night's progression, same metric family, comparable ~500k-S1 sample size:**
0.6636 -> 0.6762 -> 0.6840 -> 0.6903 -> 0.6916 -> 0.7059 -> 0.7501 -> 0.7894 -> **0.8278**
(baseline -> exact-match -> sorted-token -> rank/context -> LGB tuning -> nospace ->
address-exact -> address-normalization-fix -> address-sorted+native-script-fix). Cumulative
+0.1642 (+24.7% relative) over the first real submission. Blocking recall: 56.10% -> 57.75% ->
59.02% -> 61.47% -> 65.72% -> 69.99% -> **74.61%**.
